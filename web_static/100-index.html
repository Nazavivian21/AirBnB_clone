							<h3>From Shiza Quin the 29th June 2017</h3>
							<p>The location is fantastic its just a short walk from numerous cafes, 
								restaurants, and public transport. The kitchen was fully equipped, 
								which was perfect for when I wanted to cook my own meals.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h3>From Lan Dylion the 27th January 2017</h3>
							<p> The Wi-Fi was fast and reliable, making it easy for me to work remotely.
								Overall, I had an amazing experience and would highly recommend 
								this place to anyone visiting the city.

							<h3>From Abishola Willa the 26th February 2015</h3>
							<p>The location is unbeatable, right in the heart of downtown, close to shops, 
								restaurants, and nightlife. However, I encountered a few issues during my stay. 
								The noise from the street was quite loud, especially at night, which made it difficult to sleep.
								Additionally, the cleanliness of the bathroom could have been better. </p>

							<h3>From Christian Hart the 22nd January 2017</h3>
							<p>
								The surroundings are peaceful and picturesque, making it the perfect spot for a relaxing getaway.
								The host was very attentive and ensured that we had everything we needed.
								The cottage itself is charming, with rustic decor and all the essential amenities.
								However, the Wi-Fi signal was a bit weak, which made it challenging to stay connected at times. 
								Despite this, the overall experience was very enjoyable, 
								and I would recommend it to anyone looking to unwind in nature.
